    <p>
      I'm a systems and software engineer who's been in the industry for the
      last decade working in both Windows and Linux. I've provided solutions
      for the government, healthcare, defense, marketing automation, and
      financial industries. A firm believer in learning one level below any
      problem that I need to solve, I've worked with most major programming
      languages, networking, cloud providers, and at the operating system level
      in order to find a solution with proper trade-offs for the task at hand.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Outside of the aformentioned work, I also served in the US
      military for a total of 12 years. The first six were as a member of the US
      Army where I had primarily focused on munitions logistics with brief
      stints in theatre-level intelligence and end-user desktop support. After
      my first enlistment, I joined the US Air Force where I worked with radio
      frequency systems leading frequency management, equipment inventory,
      solution engineering, as well as compliance with regulations from federal,
      military, and international entities.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4">
      On the personal side, I have a love of learning new things and tackling
      technical topics where I don't have previous expertise. My general
      preference is going as low-level as possible with a lot of my time spent
      looking at game development, operating systems, graphics programming,
      language implementations, and offensive security.
